# Printer Camera

## Project Description

This project was conceived because I have a resin 3D printer that I want to run outside. Because the printer is outside, I need to leave it blocked from sunlight. Therefore, I cannot check on the print by lifting the lid (at least not during the daytime).

## Acceptance Criteria

Upon completion the unit will

- Turn on a camera on a set interval
- Turn on a camera with ad hoc command
- Turn on light(s) before recording with the camera
- Store videos on SSD to be accessed via SSH

## Developer Notes

The majority of the code as repurposed from the motion_camera repository. Look there for more detailed documetnation.
